# GitHub Actions + AWS OIDC Integration

This project demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow that uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure authentication with AWS. The integration allows GitHub Actions workflows to assume an AWS IAM role without the need to store AWS access keys, providing secure, short-lived credentials for AWS resource access.

- **AWS Account**: An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
- **GitHub Repository**: A personal or organization GitHub repository.
- **Terraform**: Used for managing AWS resources.
